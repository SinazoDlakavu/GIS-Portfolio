# GIS-Portfolio
ðŸŒ¿ Eastern Cape Grassland Prioritization Portfolio This portfolio showcases a series of GIS-based environmental assessments focused on identifying and prioritizing grassland areas for conservation in the Alfred Nzo District, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Using the 2022 South African National Land Cover dataset, each municipal-level project applies spatial analysis tools in QGIS â€” including land cover reclassification, proximity analysis, and raster normalization â€” to map areas most at risk from human activity (built-up and cultivated land).  Key techniques include:  Land cover extraction and binary raster creation  Distance raster generation (built-up and cultivated)  Index calculation and normalization (0 = high risk, 1 = low risk)  NDWI analysis on the Buffalo River to support NDVI validation  Surface water and land-use interaction insights  The outputs include final styled maps, one-page summaries, and spatial data files for each municipality (Umzimvubu, Matatiele, Mbizana, and Ntabankulu). This work supports decision-making for biodiversity protection, ecological restoration, and integrated land-use planning in rural South Africa.
